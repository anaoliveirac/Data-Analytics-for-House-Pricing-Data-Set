# Predicting Housing Prices for Real Estate Investment  

## Overview  

As a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust, your task is to predict the market price of residential houses using a dataset of housing features. By analyzing features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and the year a house was built, you will build models to estimate housing prices in King County, Seattle, and its surroundings.  

This project involves answering a series of ten questions that guide you through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. It forms part of a hands-on learning experience designed to enhance your data analytics and machine learning skills.

## Dataset Description  

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, Washington, including homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It has been slightly modified for this project.
